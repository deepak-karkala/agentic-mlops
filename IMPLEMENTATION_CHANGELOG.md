### ✅ Issue #4: "Thin Slice" LangGraph Workflow  
**Status**: COMPLETED  
**Epic**: Backend  
**Completion Date**: 2025-09-05  

#### What Was Implemented
- [x] Minimal LangGraph graph using `MessagesState` with a single `call_llm` node
- [x] Deterministic, offline-friendly node that appends an assistant reply (no external API needed)
- [x] FastAPI endpoint `POST /api/chat` that invokes the compiled graph
- [x] Pydantic request/response models for typed contract and validation
- [x] Pytest covering the thin-slice workflow
- [x] Proper Langchain message conversion between JSON and Langchain objects
- [x] Fixed message handling with proper `HumanMessage` and `AIMessage` types

#### Key Files Created/Modified
- `libs/graph.py` - Builds the minimal LangGraph graph and node implementation
- `api/main.py` - Adds `/api/chat` endpoint and request/response models with Langchain message conversion
- `tests/test_api.py` - Adds `test_thin_slice_workflow`
- `pyproject.toml` - Adds `langgraph` and `langchain-core` dependencies

#### Challenges Encountered
1. **External LLM Calls in CI**: Network access is restricted during CI, so calling a live LLM would fail.
2. **Langchain Message Conversion**: Initial implementation used plain dictionaries, but LangGraph's `MessagesState` expects Langchain message objects (`HumanMessage`, `AIMessage`, etc.)
3. **Message Format Mismatch**: The graph node was trying to use `.get()` method on Langchain message objects which don't support dictionary-style access

#### Solutions Implemented
1. **Deterministic Node**: The `call_llm` node returns a canned assistant message (echo + status) to ensure CI reliability while validating orchestration wiring.
2. **Message Conversion Layer**: Added conversion functions `_convert_to_langchain_message()` and `_convert_from_langchain_message()` to handle proper type conversion between API JSON format and Langchain objects
3. **Proper Message Handling**: Updated the `call_llm` node to work with Langchain message objects using `isinstance()` checks and proper attribute access

#### Testing Results
- ✅ Root endpoint health check passes
- ✅ Thin-slice workflow test asserts an assistant message is produced
- ✅ Python tests pass with proper message conversion
- ✅ Frontend tests pass
- ✅ Pre-commit hooks pass with proper code formatting

### ✅ Issue #5: End-to-End Deployment & Test

### Backend Server Import Fix
- **Issue**: `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'langgraph'` when starting backend server
- **Root Cause**: FastAPI CLI (`fastapi dev`) doesn't properly activate uv virtual environment, causing import failures for langgraph and libs modules
- **Solution**: Use `PYTHONPATH=. uv run uvicorn api.main:app --reload` instead of `fastapi dev api/main.py`
- **Files Updated**:
  - `CLAUDE.md` - Updated development commands with correct server start command
  - Added troubleshooting section for this specific issue
- **Testing**: ✅ Server starts successfully and both `/` and `/api/chat` endpoints work correctly

### Previous Updates

- Fix Jest path resolution in CI for frontend tests. Root cause: CI runs `npm test --prefix frontend` from the monorepo root, which caused Jest's default `rootDir` to be the repository root instead of the `frontend` app folder. This broke alias and relative imports (e.g., `@/lib/utils` resolving incorrectly), leading to errors like "Cannot find module '../../lib/utils' from 'components/ui/button.tsx'". 
- Change: set `rootDir: __dirname` in `frontend/jest.config.js`, and make `collectCoverageFrom` patterns explicit with `<rootDir>`. Also added `testPathIgnorePatterns` and `moduleFileExtensions` for consistency.
- Result: Local and CI runs now resolve modules identically; tests pass with `npm test --prefix frontend`.
