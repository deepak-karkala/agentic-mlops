Implement issue #3 described in @context/implementation_plan.md .
Keep the UI minimal, modern, elegant and sleek like most of the top AI Chat interfaces like ChatGPT, Claude and Gemini. We will need a separate tab (canvas) in the UI to show the generated code repository (with files and folders). 
Create a separate feature branch, once the implementation is complete, raise a pull request to main branch.
Before committing changes, ensure that CI tests are passing locally.
